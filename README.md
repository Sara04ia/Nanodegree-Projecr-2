# Nanodegree-Project2
## Disaster Response Pipelines

### Project Summary

This Project is part of Data Science Nanodegree Program 

This project is divided in the following key sections:
1) Processing data by building an ETL pipeline and it's contains :
		1) Loads the messages and categories dataset
		2) Merges the two datasets
		3) Cleans the data
		4) Stores it in a SQLite database

3) Build a machine learning pipeline to train and it's contains :
		1) Loads data from the SQLite database
		2) Splits data into training set and testing set
		3) Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline
		4) Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV
		5) Outputs result on the test set
		6) Exports the final model as a pickle file
